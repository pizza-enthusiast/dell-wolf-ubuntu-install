UPDATE 18.04: Installed Ubuntu Mate, trackpad works out of the box so don't need to patch the kernel. Updated the script to just work on suspend (which is still flaky).

This is a series of tweaks to get the trackpad/suspend working on a Dell Chromebook 11 with Ubuntu-Gnome 14.04.1.

GUIDING-SCRIPT.sh moves copies the modified files to the correct place (you can view the file and use guiding-script as a guide also). Run this script as root.

Most of what is here is taken from the arch wiki's dell chromebook 11 / chromebook / acer 720 pages. Also, got alot of help from the following google plus thread: https://plus.google.com/+PedroLarroy/posts/6CgQypQukMa
